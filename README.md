# top_calculator
Calculator project from the odin project. Created completely by me. 

The odin project is a free and self-paced online bootcamp. This is the final project from the foundations course. 

I recieved no direct code or help outside of the project description/stack MDN documentation. This was not a simple follow along tutorial project. I learned how to implement real javascript logic.
